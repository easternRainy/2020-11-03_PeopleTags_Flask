# PeopleTags
- [Demo Site](http://34.204.196.197:5003)

This is a flask website to manage personal social information. You could add persons, saving their information, adding them to groups, and tagging posts with persons or groups. All information is private except public posts, which could be seen by ANY user.

This website is adapted from my homework project, in which my team use Java Servlet to complete the website. Please checkout [here](https://github.com/secregister01/2019-10-28_PeopleTags.git) for the previous work.
